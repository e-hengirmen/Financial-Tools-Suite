# ROI-calculator
This is my own return on investment calculator. It is quite basic and for my own use. Just putting it here so that I dont recode it every time.

Since Some of my friends asked me to add a main.py I have added. It I am sharing how to use it below:

# How to use
1. Go into main.py
2. Go to variables section
3. Choose the operaiton you want
   1. ROI_CALCULATOR
   2. VALUATION_CALCULATOR
   3. BOTH_CALCULATORS 
4. Change the variables for your operation
5. Don't forget to change enflation estimator list to your estimations esspecially if you are not leaving in a high enflation country. 
6. run main.py
```
python3 main.py
```

## important note:
The default estimations for yearly enflation are quite high first year being %60. This is because in turkey this is the current enflation rate. Thats why if u live somewhere else Deinitely set enflation estimator lists in variables to your own rates:  
[1.6, 1.4, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1]
